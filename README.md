# Logistics Login Demo

This example uses **Vue 3**, **Element Plus**, and **Vite** to provide a simple professional login page for a shipping logistics company. Only email and password fields are included.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Visit the printed local URL to view the page.

## Build for Production

Run `npm run build` and serve the generated files in `dist/` with any static web server.
